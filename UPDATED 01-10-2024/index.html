                                                This is a condition caused by a lack of red blood cells or
                                                haemoglobin.<br><br>
                                                The most common reason for developing anaemia is not having enough iron.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Haemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. It traps oxygen from
                                                the
                                                lungs and carries it
                                                around the body. <br>A key ingredient used to make haemoglobin is iron.
                                                If
                                                there
                                                isn’t enough iron
                                                stored in the body, then the amount of haemoglobin drops. <br>When
                                                haemoglobin
                                                reaches a low level,
                                                less oxygen can be carried in the blood. <br><br>
                                                This can cause symptoms such as:

                                                There are several reason why you might not have enough iron in your
                                                body:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>there might not be enough iron in your diet</li>
                                                <li>your gut may not absorb enough iron from your food (even if you have

                                                <li>your iron requirements might be so high that you can’t get enough

                                                    diet (your baby
                                                    needs a lot of extra iron when it’s growing in the womb. <br>It gets

                                                    that your own iron stores can become lower)</li>
                                                <li>you may lose iron through bleeding, such as by having heavy periods

                                                    because
                                                    you have another medical condition.</li>

                                                In fact, over 20% of pregnant women in Europe are anaemic during

                                                As anaemia is so common during pregnancy, all women in the UK are
                                                screened for
                                                anaemia at their

                                                Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test. <br><br>
                                                As anaemia is so common in pregnancy, your GP will routinely check your
                                                haemoglobin levels.
                                                <br><br>
                                                All pregnant women are screened for anaemia at their first booking visit
                                                and at

                                                If you are at an increased risk of anaemia, you may be screened more

                                                A good balanced diet is vital to make sure you receive enough iron. <br>
                                                The most easily absorbed iron comes from red meat, fish and poultry.
                                                However,
                                                other vegetarian
                                                options exist, including lentis, fortified cereals and green leafy
                                                vegetables,
                                                such as spinach.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Vitamin C can help your body to absorb iron from food; this is found in
                                                orange
                                                juice and other
                                                fruits and vegetables. <br><br>
                                                Some foods can reduce your ability to absorb iron, so should be avoided

                                                iron-rich foods and/or take your iron tablets. These include tea, coffee
                                                and
                                                foods containing
                                                calcium, such as milk and other dairy products and alternatives, some
                                                seeds,
                                                pulses and
                                                vegetables,

                                                <strong>Iron Tablets</strong> <br><br>
                                                Oral iron tablets are very effective at replacing the iron needed for
                                                haemoglobin levels to
                                                rise.
                                                Some iron tablets can also come with folic acid and Vitamin C, which
                                                helps with
                                                the absorption
                                                of

                                                effectiveness is to take a tablet with orange juice one hour before

                                                are ineffective or cannot be used. The aim of the therapy is to
                                                replenish the
                                                body iron stores

                                                to remedy anaemia, a reduced level of haemoglobin due to iron
                                                deficiency. It is

                                                <strong>How FERINJECT is given</strong><br><br>
                                                Your doctor can administer FERINJECT by three possible routes: <br>
                                                Undiluted by injection, <br>
                                                During haemodialyis, <br>
                                                Or diluted by infusion. <br><br>
                                                By injection, you may receive up to 20 mL of FERINJECT, corresponding to
                                                1000mg
                                                of iron, once a
                                                week
                                                directly into the vein. <br><br>
                                                Your doctorwill take responsibility for determining the appropriate dose
                                                and
                                                choosing the
                                                method,
                                                frequency, and duration of your treatment. <br>
                                                You may be re-assessed after 4 weeks to determine whether you need more
                                                FERINJECT injections.
                                                <br>
                                                FERINJECT will be administered in a setting where possible allergic
                                                reactions
                                                can receive
                                                appropriate and prompt treatment. <br><br>
                                                You will be observed for about 30 minutes by your doctor or nurse after
                                                each
                                                administration.
