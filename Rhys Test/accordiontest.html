                            This is a condition caused by a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin.<br><br>
                            The most common reason for developing anaemia is not having enough iron.
                            <br><br>
                            Haemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. It traps oxygen from the
                            lungs and carries it
                            around the body. A key ingredient used to make haemoglobin is iron. If there
                            isn’t enough iron
                            stored in the body, then the amount of haemoglobin drops. When haemoglobin
                            reaches a low level,
                            less oxygen can be carried in the blood. <br><br>
                            This can cause symptoms such as:

                            There are several reason why you might not have enough iron in your body:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>there might not be enough iron in your diet</li>
                            <li>your gut may not absorb enough iron from your food (even if you have an
                                iron-rich diet)</li>
                            <li>your iron requirements might be so high that you can’t get enough from your
                                diet (your baby
                                needs a lot of extra iron when it’s growing in the womb. It gets the iron
                                from you, which
                                means
                                that your own iron stores can become lower)</li>
                            <li>you may lose iron through bleeding, such as by having heavy periods before
                                pregnancy, or
                                because
                                you have another medical condition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It is possible to have more than one of these causes, especially during
                            pregnancy. <br><br>
                            In fact, over 20% of pregnant women in Europe are anaemic during
                            pregnancy!<br><br>
                            As anaemia is so common during pregnancy, all women in the UK are screened for
                            anaemia at their
                            booking visit and at 28 weeks of pregnancy.

                            Anaemia can be detected by a simple blood test. <br><br>
                            As anaemia is so common in pregnancy, your GP will routinely check your
                            haemoglobin levels.
                            <br><br>
                            All pregnant women are screened for anaemia at their first booking visit and at
                            28 weeks of
                            pregnancy. <br><br>
                            If you are at an increased risk of anaemia, you may be screened more frequently.

                            <strong>Diet</strong><br><br>
                            A good balanced diet is vital to make sure you receive enough iron. <br>
                            The most easily absorbed iron comes from red meat, fish and poultry. However,
                            other vegetarian
                            options exist, including lentis, fortified cereals and green leafy vegetables,
                            such as spinach.
                            <br><br>
                            Vitamin C can help your body to absorb iron from food; this is found in orange
                            juice and other
                            fruits and vegetables. <br><br>
                            Some foods can reduce your ability to absorb iron, so should be avoided around
                            the time you eat
                            iron-rich foods and/or take your iron tablets. These include tea, coffee and
                            foods containing
                            calcium, such as milk and other dairy products and alternatives, some seeds,
                            pulses and
                            vegetables,
                            and many multi-vitamin tablets. <br><br>
                            <strong>Iron Tablets</strong> <br><br>
                            Oral iron tablets are very effective at replacing the iron needed for
                            haemoglobin levels to
                            rise.
                            Some iron tablets can also come with folic acid and Vitamin C, which helps with
                            the absorption
                            of
                            iron from the gut. <br><br>
                            The recommended tablets for treating iron deficiency anaemia are ferrous
                            sulphate tablets. How
                            well
                            these iron tablets work is greatly affected by how they are taken. The best way
                            to maximise
                            their
                            effectiveness is to take a tablet with orange juice one hour before meals. Of
                            you don’t drink
                            orange
                            juice, then another drink containing Vitamin C will also work. Your midwife or
                            doctor will be
                            able
                            to advise you on alternative drinks. <br><br>
                            Your GP or midwife will give you further guidance on how many iron tablets to
                            take per day.

                            <strong>What FERINJECT is given for:</strong><br><br>
                            FERINJECT is given for the treatment of patients with iron deficiency, when oral
                            iron
                            preparations
                            are ineffective or cannot be used. The aim of the therapy is to replenish the
                            body iron stores
                            and
                            to remedy anaemia, a reduced level of haemoglobin due to iron deficiency. It is
                            also used when
                            there
                            is a clinical need to deliver iron rapidly.<br><br>
                            Before administration, your doctor will perform a blood test to calculate the
                            dose of FERINJECT
                            you
                            require.<br><br>
                            <strong>Before you are given FERINJECT</strong><br><br>
                            When you must not be given FERINJECT:<br>
                            - If you are hypersensitive (allergic) to ferric carboxymaltose or any of the
                            other ingredients
                            in
                            FERINJECT,<br>
                            - If you have anaemia <strong>not</strong> caused by iron deficiency,<br>
                            - If you have iron overload (too much iron in your body) or disturbances in
                            utilization of
                            iron.<br><br>
                            <strong>You must tell your doctor if:</strong><br><br>
                            - If you are under the age of 14 years, <br>
                            - You have an infection, asthma, eczemas, allergies or liver disorders.<br>
                            - You are pregnant or breastfeeding.<br>
                            - If you have or have had low levels of phosphate in the blood. <br><br>
                            <strong>You should be aware that:</strong><br><br>
                            Intravenous iron preparations can cause severe allergic reactions. These
                            allergic reactions may
                            include chest pain. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience it.<br><br>
                            <strong>How FERINJECT is given</strong><br><br>
                            Your doctor can administer FERINJECT by three possible routes: <br>
                            Undiluted by injection, <br>
                            During haemodialyis, <br>
                            Or diluted by infusion. <br><br>
                            By injection, you may receive up to 20 mL of FERINJECT, corresponding to 1000mg
                            of iron, once a
                            week
                            directly into the vein. <br><br>
